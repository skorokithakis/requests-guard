requests-guard is a small library that allows you to impose size and time limits on your HTTP requests.

* Free software: BSD license
* Documentation: https://requests-guard.readthedocs.org.

Features
--------

* Timeout limits
* Size limits
* Much more!

Installation
------------

Just use ``pip`` to install it::

    pip install requests-guard

and you're done.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    import requests
    from requests_guard import guard

    r = requests.get("https://www.google.com/", stream=True, timeout=30)
    content = guard(r, max_size=3000, timeout=10)


``requests-guard`` will raise a ``ValueError`` if it receives more than ``max_size`` data in total, or if the *entire*
request takes more than ``timeout`` seconds to be completed. That means that the call will always return after (roughly,
see below for details) ``timeout`` seconds.

*Note:* You *must* call requests in the manner above, with ``stream=True`` and ``timeout``. ``stream=True`` allows the size
and time limits to be set, and the ``timeout`` parameter to ``requests`` instructs it to close the connection if no data
has been received for that number of seconds.

*Note:* ``requests-guard`` works by looking at the data as it receives it, so the ``timeout`` parameter to ``requests-guard``
will apply to the *entire* connection, not just the latest chunk. The ``timeout`` parameter to ``requests`` means "quit if
we haven't received any data for that long", which means that a response may take an arbitrary amount of time, as long
as it always returns *something* every ``timeout`` seconds. This means that a request may potentially take up to the sum
of the timeout specified to ``requests`` and to ``requests-guard``, if the server stops replying completely just before
the timeout in ``requests-guard`` elapses.
